# openshell-driver-docker

Docker-backed compute driver for local OpenShell gateways.

The driver manages sandbox containers through the local Docker daemon with the
`bollard` client. It is intended for developer environments where Docker is
already available and running Kubernetes would be unnecessary.

## Runtime Model

The gateway runs as a host process. The Docker driver creates one container per
sandbox and starts the `openshell-sandbox` supervisor inside that container. The
supervisor then creates the nested sandbox namespace for the agent process.

Docker containers join an OpenShell-managed bridge network. The driver injects
`host.openshell.internal` and `host.docker.internal` so supervisors have stable
names for reaching the gateway host. On Docker Desktop, Colima, Rancher
Desktop, OrbStack, and macOS-hosted gateways, those names use Docker's
`host-gateway` alias. On native Linux Docker, the gateway also binds the bridge
gateway IP so containers can call back to the host process.

## Container Contract

The driver-controlled container settings are part of the sandbox security
contract:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user = "0"` | The supervisor needs root inside the container to prepare namespaces, mounts, Landlock, and seccomp. |
| `network_mode = openshell` | Places the supervisor on the managed Docker bridge network. |
| `cap_add` | Grants supervisor-only capabilities required for namespace setup and process inspection. |
| `apparmor=unconfined` | Avoids Docker's default profile blocking required mount operations. |
| `restart_policy = unless-stopped` | Keeps managed sandboxes resumable across daemon or gateway restarts. |
| CDI GPU request | Uses the sandbox `gpu_device` value when set; otherwise requests all NVIDIA GPUs when the sandbox spec asks for GPU support and daemon CDI support is detected. |

The agent child process does not retain these supervisor privileges.

## Supervisor Binary Resolution

The Docker driver bind-mounts a host-side Linux `openshell-sandbox` binary into
each sandbox container. Resolution order is:

1. `supervisor_bin` in `[openshell.drivers.docker]`.
2. A sibling `openshell-sandbox` next to the running `openshell-gateway` binary.
3. A local Linux cargo target build for the Docker daemon architecture.
4. `supervisor_image` in `[openshell.drivers.docker]`, or the
   release-matched default supervisor image, extracting `/openshell-sandbox`.

Release and Docker-image gateway builds bake the matching supervisor image tag
into the binary at compile time. The default Docker supervisor image is not
`:latest` unless a custom build explicitly sets that tag.

## Callback and TLS

`OPENSHELL_ENDPOINT` is injected from the gateway's configured gRPC endpoint.
When no endpoint is configured, the driver uses
`host.openshell.internal:<gateway-port>` with the appropriate HTTP or HTTPS
scheme. Set `host_gateway_ip` only when the host has an explicit, locally
assigned address that containers should use for callbacks; package-managed
macOS gateways should leave it unset.

For HTTPS endpoints, the server certificate must include the endpoint host as a
subject alternative name. Docker sandboxes also need the client TLS bundle
mounted into the container and exposed with:

- `OPENSHELL_TLS_CA`
- `OPENSHELL_TLS_CERT`
- `OPENSHELL_TLS_KEY`

HTTP endpoints reject TLS material because the supervisor would not use it.

## Environment Ownership

The driver merges template environment and sandbox spec environment first, then
overwrites security-critical keys:

- `OPENSHELL_ENDPOINT`
- `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_ID`
- `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX`
- `OPENSHELL_SSH_SOCKET_PATH`
- `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_COMMAND`
- TLS path variables when HTTPS is enabled

Do not allow sandbox images or templates to override these values.
